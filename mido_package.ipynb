    "This is because in MIDI sequencing, time is cumulative from the last event. When the first note_off message is sent (for triad[0]), it includes a delay (the duration for which the chord is held), and then it turns off the first note of the triad. For the next notes in the triad, we set time=0 because we want them to turn off simultaneously with the first note. If we added a delay to these notes as well, they would turn off sequentially, not simultaneously, and that would not correctly represent a chord being released."
